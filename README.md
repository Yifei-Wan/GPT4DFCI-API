# OncDRS chatbot üîå

This project facilitates the embedding of CSV and TXT files into a vector database using Azure OpenAI. It leverages Chroma DB to store these embeddings and provides an API interface for generating answers based on the vector database. This setup allows for advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Prerequisites

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.

If you are already familiar with Poetry, or are comfortable setting up your own environment with other tools, you can probably skip this.

### Installing Poetry & Azure CLI

#### For macOS this would be the suggested way:

- Install brew: 

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- Install poetry using: 
```
brew install poetry
```

- Install Azure CLI
```
brew install azure-cli
```

### Installing GPT4DFCI API dependencies

After installing Poetry, navigate to the directory you are interested in and run:

```
poetry install --no-root
```

This should create a virtual environment with the dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml` installed.

### Set up vector database & login Azure
Download the vector database based on [OncDRS documents](https://wiki.dfci.harvard.edu:8443/oncdoc) from the S3 bucket, and log in to Azure:
```
bash chatbot_setup.sh
```

Close the window after logging in and get back to the shell.

## üü¢  Run the chatbot demo

### Set up environment variables
In the file called `.env`, fill in the following values:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://...
AZURE_OPENAI_ENTRA_SCOPE=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
CHROMADB_STORAGE_PATH=./chromadb
```

`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` should be the GPT4DFCI API endpoint, without the `/openai` suffix.

`AZURE_OPENAI_ENTRA_SCOPE` should be the scope required for the bearer token, the UUID `client_id`.

`CHROMADB_STORAGE_PATH` should be the path to the ChromaDB vector database.


### VPN

```
Turn on the VPN or make sure you are running from an on-prem resource.
```

### Run the demo
```
bash chatbot_demo.sh -q "<Your question about OncDRS>"
```

### Shutting down

When finished working, shut the current virtual environment with

```
deactivate
```
